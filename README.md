CS50's Final Project

This Stock (and Crypto) Tracker is a web application that allows users to track stock and cryptocurrency prices in real-time. The application fetches data from external APIs and displays it in an intuitive user interface.  
This is mainly the Stock Tracker, but I added Crypto Tracker as well (but it has a problem with CoinGecko API rate limit, so it may not work correctly).

## Task List
- [x] Stocks
  - [x] Backend implementation
  - [x] Frontend implementation
  - [x] Integration and testing
- [x] Crypto
  - [x] Backend implementation
  - [x] Frontend implementation
  - [x] Integration and testing

> [!TIP]

> [!CAUTION]
> Because a CoinGecko API rate limit for crypto, the crypto feature ara may not working correctly because it is simply cannot fetch data from CoinGecko API.
